<h1> Cord19 Language Model </h1>

<p>This codebase can be used to build a language model from scratch on the Cord19 dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge </p>

<p>There are two scripts in this codebase -</p>

<ol>
<li><b>dataprep.py</b></li>
<p>This script is used for Data Cleaning, Preprocessing and Preparation of Train and Validation Sets for the Language Model.</p>

<li><b>train.py</b></li>
<p>This script is used to build a Language Model from scratch on the training set.</p>
</ol>
